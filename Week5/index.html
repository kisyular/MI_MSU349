                      I am passionate about technology, but to be precise, I am passionate about information and communication technologies that can improve the lives of others.  I have always wondered how technology could be used to empower and bring development to developing countries, especially the rural areas of such countries.

                      Over the summer, I live in Nairobi. The capital city of Kenya has the necessary resources for the informatics, computer scientist, technologist and game developer I want to be. Nairobi has electricity supply through government, and Internet connections powered by major phone service providers and even private organizations. However, to access the Internet, it is quite expensive to the common citizen and its bandwidth is also quite low, hence a slow Internet connection.

                      But in Tsavo, a small town in southern Kenya, it is almost the opposite of Nairobi. Here, the electricity grid system does not exist. Internet access is quite limited and the concept of net neutrality does not exist here. This is where I was born.

                      This past summer, I travelled to Kenya for my internship with mSurvey. My duties were centered on application programming interface (API) programming. This involved pulling data online, running analysis and creating dashboard with help of software called Keen.IO.
