                      During my internship, I visited the village high school in my home village of Tsavo to give a presentation about The MasterCard Foundation Scholars Program. The majority of the students I spoke to were very shocked that such kind of scholarship existed. Others were inquisitive and wanted to know how they could access information. When I explained to them that the scholarship information was available online, their hopes and curiosity crashed.

                      Deep in my village, there is no Internet access. Access to laptops is also a privilege. While I know that The MasterCard Foundation’s partners often make recruitment trips to rural areas across the continent, I wanted to empower these young people. I felt challenged to make this information available to them, so I came up with an idea.

                    <p class="para">
                      First, I built an automated Short Messaging Service (SMS) bot. I used Twilio to power an SMS service which was automated to respond with information about The MasterCard Foundation scholarship. Twilio uses application program interface (API) keys to pull data on the web and send it as a text to phones once a trigger is activated by sending a specific code. However, after a few days, the first prototype failed. It required a lot of knowledge about APIs and libraries, to which I have not yet had enough exposure. That was when I decided to move to Facebook’s messenger platform.

                      The Facebook messenger bot works the same way as the Twilio SMS Bot. With messenger bot, you can send and receive APIs, hence you are able to send and receive text, and call to action (CTA)buttons. CTA buttons allow a response sent by a bot to be linked to any destination or website on or off Facebook. The bot also has a generic message template in which a user can press a CTA button to get information instead of typing the commands.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Although still a prototype, the infomcf bot I designed helps to get information about The MasterCard Foundation scholarship to a greater number of deserving young people. It can pull all the data explaining how to apply, what deadlines are important, requirements and qualifications for universities in The MasterCard Foundation partnership. The bot is faster and consumes less Internet data compared to accessing such large pieces of information through a browser.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">
                      It is my hope that I will develop a successful bot and harness its huge potential which can be tapped to impact all youth in Africa, assisting them in their applications and to connect with other potential Scholars, and helping them to bridge our continent’s last mile.
